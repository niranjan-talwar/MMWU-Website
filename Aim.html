    <h1 id="aim"><u>Aim of MMWU</u></h1>
    <p>For the effectively early realization of the aims and goals set out in the Narora Declaration, the Working Committee resolves to make the INTUC still more powerful and effective instrument of social justice and the vanguard of the forces of freedom, democracy and progress. Among others , the concentration will be on our,</p>
    <p>Achieving a membership of one crore within a period of five years. For the purpose, we will have to set about the task of further strengthening of our affiliates who are mainly in the organized sector of the industry as well as to organize the unorganized in the growing informal and sprawling rural sector. The State Branches of INTUC and National Industrial Federations are called upon to convene special meeting of their Working Committees for detailed review of the existing organizational situation and to plan for the future to achieve the goal of the INTUC to have a membership of one crore. The programme should be time scheduled and properly targeted with provision for regular periodic and systematic review and appraisal.</p>
    <p>For achieving the above the Working Committee will give all possible cooperation and help. It offers the following suggestions for the purpose:-</p>
</div>
    
    <ul>
        <li>That review of existing organizational situation should be brutally frank even sometimes agonizing, so that suitable and bold steps are taken to remedy the weakness;</li>
        <li>That greater stress on internal democracy and greater involvement of rank and file of the members should be laid to ensure that our affiliates more truly reflect the aspirations, problems and difficulties of their membership. For the purpose, well known methods like energising shop and local committee, education of membership and training of leadership would be given more importance.</li>
        <li>Every member, quite naturally, judges the organization by his or her own experience of the organization. To the extent the organization has helped him or her during the time of need determines his or her response and loyalty. it is, therefore, essential for union leaders to give greater attention to the individual problems of the members and to do their utmost for their satisfactory redressal.</li>
        <li>Trade Unions, no doubt, have to give attention to the problems of the memberes relating to the working conditions and other conditions of employment. These must be given due consideration and effective steps must be taken for their redressal through the established grievance redressal machinery in which the shop steward is the king pin. He must be enable to be more effective through proper training and councelling.</li>
    </ul>

    <p id="points">The following areas need to be immediately discussed for the preparation of guidelines for our affiliates:</p>
    <ol>
        <li> Workers participation in Equity and Management;</li>
        <li>Education Research and Training;</li>
        <li>Health services;</li>
        <li>Social security;</li>
        <li>Employment creation</li>
    </ol>

    <p id="newpt">The president would appoint the Study Groups for each of the above, which are required to submit their recommendations for consideration.</p>
